"""
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check).
If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
