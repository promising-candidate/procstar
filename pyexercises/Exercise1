"""
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells
them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Extras:

Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous
message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines.
(Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)
