PAN - Primary Account Number
PCI/DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

Part 1 - Introduction

Why do we need PCI/DSS
Fraud losses are estimated to be in the billions
Identity Theft
Legal Costs, Settlements and Judgements
Higher Subsequent costs of compliance
Lost customer confidence
Lost Sales
Cost of re-issuing new payment cards
Loss of ability to process payment cards

Who must comply with PCI/DSS standards
PCI security for merchants and payment card processors is the vital result of applying the information security best practices in the payment card industry data security standards (PCI/DSS). This standard includes 12 requirements for any business that stores, processes, or transmits payment cardholder data
PCI DSS is the global security standard that any business of any size must adhere to in order to accept payment cards, and to store, process, or transmit cardholder data. It presents common sense steps that mirror best security best practices.

Where is data vulnerable
Data in a payment system database
Compromised card readers and PoS systems
Paper records improperly stored
Hidden camera recording of authentication data
Secret tap into stores wired or wireless network
ATM’s modified to contain software or hardware shims
Residual information in RAM of systems that accept payment card information (ram scraping)

Part 2 - Attacks and sources of risk

Well-known attacks
In 2012, about 40 million sets of PCI were compromised by a hack on Adobe Systems.
In July 2013, press reports indicated four Russians and a Ukrainian were indicted in New Jersey for what was called “the largest hacking and data breach scheme ever prosecuted in the United States”
Between November-December of 2013, a breach of Target Corporation  resulted in exposed data from about 40 million credit cards. The information stolen included names, expiry date, account number and security code
From July-October of 2013, a hacking attack compromised about a million sets of payment card data stored on computers at Neiman-Marcus
On September 8th 2014, The Home Depot confirmed that their payments systems were compromised and released a statement saying a total of 56 million credit card numbers were disclosed as a result.

Common Sources
Outsider attack
Insider-accidental
Insider-malicious

Common Types
Stolen laptop or computer
Exposure on Internet or E-mail
Hack
Documents lost in the mail or on disposal
Scams and Social Engineering

Part 3 - PCI Tools
PCI SSC - The PCI Security Standards Council offers robust and comprehensive standards and supporting materials to enhance payment card data security
PCI DSS - Provides an actionable framework for developing a robust payment card data security process - including prevention, detection, and appropriate reaction to security incidents
Qualified Security Assessors - QSA’s  are approved by the council to assess compliance with PCI-DSS
Self-Assessment Questionnaire - SAQ’s is a validation tool for organizations that are not required to undergo an on-site assessment 

Part 4 - Goals and Requirements

What is PCI DSS
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
The goal of PCI DSS is to protect cardholder data that is processed, stored, or transmitted by merchants
The security controls and processes required by PCI DSS are vital for protecting cardholder account data, including the PAN printed on the front of the card


Goals
PCI DSS Requirements
Build and maintain a secure network
1.Install and a maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data
2.Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for passwords or other security parameters
Protect Cardholder Data
3. Protect Stored Data
4.Encrypt transmission of cardholder data on open, public networks
Maintain a vulnerability management program
5.Use and regularly update anti-virus software
6.Develop and maintain secure systems and applications
Implement Strong Access Control measures
7. Restrict access to cardholder data to business need-to-know
8. Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access
9.Restrict physical access to cardholder data
Regularly monitor and test networks
10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data
11.Regularly test security systems and processes
Maintain an Information Security Policy
12. Maintain a policy that addresses information security

Part 5 - PCI DSS requirements in depth

Build and maintain a secure network
Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data
Standards for configuration and testing
“Deny All” from untrusted networks
Prohibit direct public access between the internet and any system component in the cardholder data environment
Personal firewall software must be installed on mobile devices and/or employee owned computers used to access the organizations network
     2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for passwords or other security parameters 
Most vendor defaults are simple and easy to guess
Frequently designed for ease of use
Passwords and other default settings should be changed before connected installing on network
Define and apply system base-lines and standard configurations addressing known vulnerabilities
Encrypt all non-console administrative access
	3. Protect stored cardholder data
Limit storage and retention
Don’t store sensitive authentication information after authorization
Mask the PAN when displayed (1st 6 or last 4)
Protect keys used for encryption
Document and manage all key management processes and procedures
	4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data
Use strong cryptography and transport protocols like SSL/TLS or IPSEC for transmission over open, public networks (Internet, wireless, etc)
Never send PAN’s unencrypted by end-user messaging technologies
	5. Use and regularly update anti-virus software or programs
Deploy anti-virus software on all systems affected by malicious software
Ensure that all anti-virus software is current and actively running and capable of generating audit logs
	6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications
Ensure all system components and software have the latest vendor-supplied patches (critical patches installed within a month)
Establish a process to identify new vulnerabilities (alert services, vulnerability scans/services)
Develop software applictions in accordance with PCI DSS based on industry best practices and incorporate information security throughout the software development life cycle
Follow change control procesdures for all changes to system components
Develop web-based applications based on secure coding guidelines
Ensure all public web-facing applications are protected
	7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-known
Allow access only as job requires access
Establish access control system for components with multiple users. Default to “deny all” unless specifically allowed
	8. Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access
Assign all users a unique user name before allowing them access
Require authentication by password, passphrase, or two-factor authentication
Implement two-factor authentication for remote access to the network by empployees administrators and third parties
Render all password unreadable for storage and transmission
Ensure proper user authentication and password management for non-consumer users and administrators on all system components
9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data
Use facility controls to limit and monitor physical access in the data environments
Develop procedures to help personnel easily distinguish between employess and visitors
Ensure all visitors are authorized before allowing entry to sensitive areas
Use a visitor log to maintain a physical audit trail
Store media back-ups in a secure location
Physically secure all paper and electronic media containing card holder data
Control internal/external distribution of any kind of media containing cardholder data
Ensure that mgmt approves moving secured media
Maintain strict control over storage and accessibility of media
Destroy media containing cardholder data when no longer needed
10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data
Link all access to an individual users
Implement audit trails
Record audit trail entries for each event including user id, type of event, date and time, success/failure, identity or name of affected data syncronize all critical system clocks and times
Secure audit trails to prevent alterations
Review logs for security functions (at least) daily
Retain audit trail history for at least one year with 3 months being immediately available for analysis
	11. Regularly test security systems and processes
Test for unauthorized wireless access points at least quarterly
