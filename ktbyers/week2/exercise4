4. Read in the "show_ip_int_brief.txt" file into your program using the
.readlines() method.

Obtain the list entry associated with the FastEthernet4 interface.
You can just hard-code the index at this point since
we haven't covered for-loops or regular expressions.
Use the string .split() method to obtain both the IP address and
the corresponding interface associated with the IP.

Create a two element tuple from the result (intf_name, ip_address).

Print that tuple to the screen.

Use pycodestyle on this script. Get the warnings/errors to zero. You might
need to 'pip install pycodestyle' on your
computer (you should be able to type this from the shell prompt).
Alternatively, you can type 'python -m pip install pycodestyle'.
